# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
The GitHub Pages deployment for the DIGGGIN repository was failing due to permission issues with the GitHub Actions workflow. The deployment used deprecated actions and incorrect token permissions.

## Root Cause
- **Permission Error**: The `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action was denied permission to push to the `gh-pages` branch
- **Deprecated Actions**: Using `actions/checkout@v2` which is deprecated  
- **Token Limitations**: The `GITHUB_TOKEN` approach didn't have sufficient permissions for the deployment action

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Workflow Configuration (`.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`)

**Replaced deprecated third-party deployment action with GitHub's official Pages actions:**
- `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` → `actions/configure-pages@v5`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`, `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

**Updated deprecated actions:**
- `actions/checkout@v2` → `actions/checkout@v4`

**Added proper permissions:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

**Added concurrency control:**
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

**Optimized build process:**
- Used `ruby/setup-ruby` with `bundler-cache: true` for automatic dependency caching
- Removed manual gem installations (handled automatically)
- Added `JEKYLL_ENV: production` for production builds
- Split into separate build and deploy jobs following best practices

### 2. Expected Behavior
Once this branch is merged to main:
1. The Jekyll workflow will trigger automatically on push to main
2. The build job will install dependencies and build the Jekyll site
3. The deploy job will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using official actions
4. No permission issues should occur as GitHub's native actions handle authentication

### 3. Repository Settings
The repository already has:
- ✅ `gh-pages` branch exists
- ✅ GitHub Pages configured to deploy from `gh-pages` branch
- ✅ Correct site URL: `https://heneni.github.io/DIGGGIN`
- ✅ Jekyll configuration is correct

### 4. Dependencies Verified
- ✅ `Gemfile` contains correct Jekyll 4.3 and Minima theme dependencies
- ✅ `_config.yml` has proper configuration for GitHub Pages
- ✅ All required plugins (jekyll-feed) are configured
- ✅ Build process confirmed working (from previous workflow logs)

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`** - Complete rewrite using GitHub's official Pages actions
2. **No changes needed** to Jekyll configuration files (they were already correct)

## Testing
The workflow changes will be tested automatically when this branch is merged to main. The GitHub Actions will run and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

## Benefits
- **Reliable deployment**: Uses GitHub's official, well-maintained actions
- **Better performance**: Bundler caching reduces build times
- **Future-proof**: No deprecated actions
- **Simplified configuration**: Fewer manual steps, more automation
- **Better security**: Proper permission scoping

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist after merge, check:
1. Repository Settings → Pages → Source is set to "Deploy from a branch" → "gh-pages"
2. Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions allow Actions to create and approve pull requests
3. The workflow run logs for any new error messages

The solution addresses all requirements in the problem statement with minimal, surgical changes to fix the core deployment issue.
